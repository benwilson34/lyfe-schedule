          Welcome to LyfeSchedule!! Thanks for your interest in my little productivity app 😁
        </p>

        <p>
          This app is in alpha and is being actively developed. I'm accepting any and all feedback at this time - please email me at
          <a href="mailto:benwcodes@gmail.com?subject=LyfeSchedule%20Feedback&body=I%20have%20some%20feedback%20about%20LyfeSchedule%3A%0A%0A">benwcodes@gmail.com<a>
          if you encounter a bug, have a question, or have an idea for an improvement!
        </p>

        <p>
          There is also a 
          <a href="https://docs.lyfeschedule.com/getting-started.html">User Guide</a>
          that you can refer to, although again this is very much a work-in-progress.
        </p>

          You can now sign in and start using it immediately!
