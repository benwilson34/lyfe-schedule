# Getting Started

After signing in, you'll be looking at the Calendar view with no tasks.

## Add a simple task

Click the "+ Add task" button to open a dialog where you can add the details for a new task.

Type in the `Title` of your task, for example "Read guide" or "Buy groceries".

Choose a date or date range for your task. Click once to choose a start date, then click again to choose an end
date. Click the same day twice to choose just that day.

By default, new tasks will have a time estimate of 15 minutes. You can change this value in the `Time Estimate` field
or remove the estimate by unchecking the box to the left of that field. 

Click the "ADD" button to add the task. It will immediately appear on the day you chose as the start date (or only day 
you chose). Keep in mind that you can edit any of these fields at any time.

## Add a repeating task

TODO why repeating tasks? 

Set the title, date range, and time estimate like before. Check the box to the left of `Repeat` and type in how often the task should repeat in days. For example, if you type in "every 7 days", this means that the task will repeat 7 days **after it is completed**.

## Choosing a date range

For simple tasks, I think about the date range this way: 

"When is the earliest I can start/do this task?" -> start date

"When is the latest I can complete this task?" -> end date

For repeating tasks, I think about the date range this way:

"How often is too often?" -> range 1

"How often is not often enough?" -> range 2

Then you can calculate: 

- range 1 = repeat interval
- range 2 - range 1 = date range
