## :calendar: Task Scheduling

Easily schedule tasks for today, tomorrow, or a year from now. 

## :soon: Date Ranges

Many tasks don't have a single, strict "due date" - give a task a date range and its priority will scale accordingly.

## :repeat: Repeating Tasks

Set up tasks to repeat every day, week, month, year, or something in between.

## :stopwatch: Time Estimates

Estimate how long your tasks will take so you can plan around them.
