# LyfeSchedule

_the todo app for people that get things done eventually‚Ñ¢_

![Screenshots](./readme-img/screenshots.png "LyfeSchedule Screenshots")

## Key Features

üìÜ **Task Scheduling**: Easily schedule tasks for today, tomorrow, or a year from now.

üîú **Date Ranges**: Many tasks don't have a single, strict "due date" - give a task a date range and its priority will scale accordingly.

üîÅ **Repeating Tasks**: Set up tasks to repeat every day, week, month, year, or somewhere in between.

‚è±Ô∏è **Time Estimates**: Estimate how long your tasks will take so you can plan around them.

Be sure to read the [user-facing documentation](https://docs.lyfeschedule.com/) for more info.

This app can be run locally on any machine that supports Node and MongoDB, or it can be deployed remotely "on the cloud". If you just want to try it out, there is an invite-only instance running for beta testing purposes. Send us [an email](mailto:beta@lyfeschedule.com?subject=Request%20for%20beta%20access) to request access.

# from inside the project directory
npm install
# or
yarn install
